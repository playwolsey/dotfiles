# Awwwesssooooome 's .dotfiles
=========

My dotfile configuration. Covers vim, ZSH and some other things, too.

## Installing the doftiles
**Warning:** Review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

1. Pull the project into your home directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/playwolsey/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. Run the installation script
   ```bash
   ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
   ```
